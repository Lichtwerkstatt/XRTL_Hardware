# XRTL_Hardware
Welcome to the XRTL Hardware repository! If you are trying to add actuators, sensors or cameras to your setup, you have come to the right place. You can jump right in and start building or head over to our [wiki](https://github.com/Lichtwerkstatt/XRTL_Hardware/wiki) for basic guides and more information on how to get your hardware to talk to your servers.

If you are instead looking for the software to build some servers or maybe some fancy UI, our [software repository](https://github.com/Lichtwerkstatt/XRTL_SPA) might be the right place for you.
